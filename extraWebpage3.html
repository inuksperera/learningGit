          <h3>1975 Australia vs West Indies</h3>
          <p>
            Clive Lloyd led from the front with a spectacular century in the
            final as West Indies defeated Australia by 17 runs to take the
            inaugural World Cup at Lords. After an early collapse, Lloyd's
            blistering hundred and Viv Richards' spectacular fielding had the
            Windies on top. But a stirring last-wicket stand between pace duo
            Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee kept Aussie hopes alive before Deryck
            Murray ran out Thomson to secure a thrilling win.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>1975 West Indies vs Pakistan</h3>
          <p>
            Derrick Murray and Andy Roberts put on an unbelievable last wicket
            stand to take the Windies to a miracle win over Pakistan. Mushtaq
            Mohammad made a watchful half-century, Wasim Raja made a fifty too,
            and Majid top-scored with 60 as Pakistan posted 260. The West Indies
            were staring defeat at 203-9, when Murray and Roberts came together
            to conjour a victory in the last over with a 64 run stand.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>1979 England vs New Zealand</h3>
          <p>
            In a tantalisingly close finish New Zealand fell just 9 runs short
            of making the final as they went down to England. Graham Gooch (71)
            and Mike Brearley (53) gave a splendid start but it was left to
            Derek Randall 42 to get them upto 221-8 in 60 overs. Only John
            Wright 69 offered stern resistance as the Kiwi's lost regular
            wickets to end up just short in a thriling finish.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>1983 West Indies vs India</h3>
          <p>
            India making the final itself was a shock event. The Windies pace
            attack restricted India to just 183 off 54 overs, with Kris
            Srikkanth top-scoring on 38. But on a remarkable day at Lord's, the
            Indian bowlers shocked the world champion West Indians with a
            devastating bowling display. The Indian team rejoiced after this
            famous victory that stunned the cricketing world.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>1987 Australia vs England</h3>
          <p>
            The 1987 World Cup was lifted by Allan Border captain of Australia
            who won against archrivals England by 7 runs in the most closely
            fought World Cup final to date. England were marching onto victory
            when in a moment of madness captain Mike Gatting decided to employ a
            high risk reverse sweep against the leftarm spin of his opposite
            number &#8211; Allan Border. England then collapsed from a position
            of strength with the fall of this wicket and handed an unexpected
            win to the Aussies.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>1992 Pakistan vs England</h3>
          <p>
            Imran Khan's Pakistani team defeated England in a memorable final at
            the MCG to take the 1992 World Cup. Pakistan were like "cornered
            tigers" as they played the second half of the 1992 World Cup only a
            defeat away from elimination after a poor start. Wasim Akram was the
            star as he destroyed England with his swing bowling.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>1996 Sri Lanka vs Australia</h3>
          <p>
            Sri Lankan cricket came of age in the glare of Lahore's Gaddafi
            Stadium floodlights when they beat overwhelming favourites Australia
            by seven wickets to win the World Cup. This was an upset for the
            ages as Sri Lanka had became a Test playing nation only 15 years
            before. Arjuna Ranatunga's team became the first side to win the
            trophy by chasing. It was the stuff of dreams for Sri Lanka as the
            island nation rejoiced in their most famous sporting achievement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>1996 Australia vs West Indies</h3>
          <p>
            In one of the most remarkable world cup games of all time Australia
            snatched a dramatic 5 run win after being down and out for most of
            the semi final. The Windies collapsed in spectacular fashion with
            victory in sight, crumbling from 165-2 to 202 all out. Earlier,
            Australia struggled to 207-8 after being 15-4 at one stage.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>1999 Australia vs South Africa</h3>
          <p>
            Australia and South Africa wrote one of the most astonishing
            chapters in the history of the World Cup. Big hitting allrounder
            Lance Klusener got South Africa to within 1 run of a win with 4
            balls remaining. Inexplicably he ran for glory whilst last man Allan
            Donald stood rooted at the other end before belatedly setting off.
            The run out resulted in a tied match. It was the match that had
            everything and is widely regarded as the best one day international
            ever played.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>2011 India vs Sri Lanka</h3>
          <p>
            In a dream match up, Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni led the charge as
            India won the final by defeating Sri Lanka by six wickets. Chasing
            275 for a historic win, the Indians held their nerves as they rode
            on Gautam Gambhir's 97 and Mahendra Singh Dhoni's unbeaten 91 to
            overhaul the target with 10 balls to spare and send the
            cricket-crazy nation into a frenzy. This was India's second World
            Cup victory, having previously won in 1983. India thus became the
            third nation to have won the World Cup more than once, along with
            Australia and the West Indies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2011 Ireland vs England</h3>
          <p>
            Kevin O'Brien smashed the fastest century (113) in World Cup history
            off just 50 balls as Ireland recorded their greatest win on
            cricket's biggest stage. Ireland were struggling at 111-5 chasing
            England's massive 327 for eight when O'Brien delivered an
            astonishing display of power-hitting. He beat the previous fastest
            Cup century record held by Australia's Matthew Hayden, who hit 100
            off 66 balls in 2007.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2011 India vs England</h3>
          <p>
            An epic 158 from Andrew Strauss saw England tie an extraordinary
            World Cup group B match against India. The co-hosts set an
            intimidating 339-run victory target after a superb 120 from Sachin
            Tendulkar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2015 New Zealand vs Australia</h3>
          <p>
            With six needed for the win, Kane Williamson (45 not out) hit Pat
            Cummins for a straight six to seal a thrilling 1 wicket win over
            Australia. Earlier, Trent Boult took a career-best five for 27 as
            Australia were dismissed for just 151 all out before New Zealand
            struggled to reach their victory target despite skipper Brendon
            McCullum's 24-ball 50.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2015 New Zealand vs South Africa</h3>
          <p>
            With five needed off two balls , Grant Elliott (84 not out) finished
            the innings of his life to carry NZ over his country of birth -
            South Africa - to ensure a finals berth with an extraordinary
            four-wicket win in a rain-interrupted game. The Kiwis erupted in joy
            but for AB de Villiers's men it was so close that their tears flowed
            freely.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2019 England vs New Zealand</h3>
          <p>
            In a game already labelled as the greatest ever One Day match,
            England beat New Zealand to win the World Cup after the dramatic
            final was tied twice. Both teams scored 241 in their 50 overs and
            were level on 15 when they batted for an extra over apiece. It meant
            England were crowned world champions by virtue of having scored more
            boundary fours and sixes in the entire match. This was the first tie
            in a World Cup final.
